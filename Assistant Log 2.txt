Assistant Log:
It got better.
The other day Professor King strolled in to Edwards’s lab looking his
usual. He requested our fair Professor, who was out at the time, and
left a note in his absence. I read it, of course. We all did. It said,
and I quote "We need to talk." Though I rarely interact with the
Professor, he hadn't struck me as the dramatic type. He returned later
that day when Professor Edwards was around, and I swear you could cut
the tension in that lab with a knife. Since then we have stopped
getting errand runs to the School of Technology, and I am finally
getting to do something. Now they have me measuring Athletic
Performance in variable lighting conditions. In layman’s terms, I get
to boss around football players. This is pretty great.
