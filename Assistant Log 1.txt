Logs pulled from an assistants personal journal. You're welcome.

Assistant Log:
Working for Professor Edwards has proven surprisingly boring.
He has me on a new project about insectoid lift and light refraction.
It would have been interesting if I wasn't on indefinite errand duty.
"Move these boxes. Fetch these parts. Sit down, roll over, play dead."
I didn't sign up for grunt work. The others tell me it gets better.
I have seen their schedules. Lying isn't going to improve my demeanor.
I would quit if I could. I'd walk out right now and they'd have my 
replacement before dawn. But one does not simply walk out on Professor
Edwards. That would be career suicide. We all know it.

Assistant Log:
I am still shoveling boxes. Apparently the project has moved along.
Yet here I am, still… shoveling… boxes. Now they’re from the school
of Technology. Why these buildings have multiple greens in between
them eludes me.
