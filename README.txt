PURPOSE
=====================================================================

	Mission: The veratas database is an easily sharable
	         rudimentary archive capable of restricted file
	         reading and storage on most standard computers.
	         Veratas utilizes a unique incription algorithm to
	         restrict access to files specified prior by the
	         archive owner.
	
	System Requirements: N/A -Verata functions stabily on most 
	                     standard computers.

KNOWN ERRORS
=====================================================================

	Abnormal Encryption: Encrypting a file locks all files below
	                     it behind the same key as their
	                     predecesor in a singular folder. Error
	                     most likely caused by parent dependant
	                     architecture. No known solution.
	
	Abnormal Decription: Decripted text files replace blank
	                     space with the character 'h'. Error
	                     caused by encryption failure. No known
	                     solution.
