What are the Golden Tornadoes?
That one golden question has plagued me since I began this investigation.
Every account I've gathered paints them as fantastic.
They praise their ability.
They honor their success.
Perfect players remembered through gilded glasses.
But not one of them can complete the picture.
Maybe I'm being paranoid.
Maybe all this digging's doing is leading me deeper underground.
Maybe I'm chacing fools gold.
But I'm not convinced. Not yet.
Belive me, I want to be.
But every lock I break reveals more worth breaking.
With every step I take another piece of he puzzle falls in to place.
I'm on to them. I can feel it.
Let's just hope, for my sake, they don't feel it too.
