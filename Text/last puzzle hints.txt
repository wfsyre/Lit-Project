Yes. It's this again. Belive me when I say there's no better way
to do this.
Despite being a Tech school, Georgia Tech has a huge history
in athletics. The Olympics were helled around here in 1996,
but as youve learned stranger things have happend. At the
centriod of a triangle formed by three locations lies
your final key. You know the first of them, Howey. The other
two are similarly involved. Remember that map?
If I were you, I'd get to drawing.

1) It is not a coincidence these locations tie in with the
Olympics. Many Olympians visited these locations.

2) Unlike with Howey, students congregate at these locations,
sometimes in massive swarms.

3) They are both south of Howey. One east, one west.

4) The campanile isn't the only place on campus where you can
make a splash.

5) One of these locations was the sight of a glorious victory,
a miricle one might say.

The centroid of these three points is where you would want to
continue your search. Feel free to draw on the map.
