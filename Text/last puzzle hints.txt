You think the conspiracy ends there? No, there is more to it.
Despite being a Tech school, Georgia Tech has a huge history
in athletics. What was the largest athletic event held at
Georgia Tech? The Olympics. There were some crazy things going
on on Campus. Three locations centered around something big.
You know one of them, Howey. The other two might take some
looking. Best pull out that map again.

1) It is not a coincidence these locations tie in with the
Olympics. Many Olympians visited these locations.

2) Unlike with Howey, students congregate at these locations,
sometimes in massive swarms.

3) They are both south of Howey. One east, one west.

4) The campanile isn't the only place on campus where you can
make a splash.

5) One of these locations was the sight of a glorious victory,
a miricle one might say.

The centroid of these three points is where you would want to
continue your search. Feel free to draw on the map.
