Well done!
We're quite impressed you found us.
Unfortunately that puts our organization in a rather... awkward situation.
Now, it would be rather rude of us to continue without a thank you.
Honestly, we wouldn’t be here without your help,
you clever bugger, decrypting all these files just for us~
We’re truly grateful, and truly sorry.
You would of made for a fine member if he hadn’t gotten to you first.
But fear not, brave navigator! It’ll all be over soon.
