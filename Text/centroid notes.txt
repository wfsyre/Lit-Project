LECTURE TRANSCRIPT
MATH 1551: SEPTEMBER 13th

DR GERONIMO:

Given the majority of this class seems to have skipped
geometry in highschool we will now be learning
how to locate the centroid of a triangle. We begin
by marking the midpoints of each line on the triangle.
That means we mark three lines. I repeat, a triangle
is composed of THREE SIDES. Once you have the midpoints,
draw a line between them and their opposite vertex's
The point of intersection between your three
new lines is the centriod. Simple, yeah?

Now repeat this process with variable edge points
corresponding to an elyptical and graph the third
order derivative of its area with respect to delta.
