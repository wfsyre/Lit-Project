That Fool Edwards! The nerve of him! To think that such a man
set singularly on a dilusion of glory exist amongs our ranks,
and as the top of an entire department no less. Outrageous!
That... that no good exploitive Gloryhound! How dare he rope
me in to this nonsense! I've read the reaserch, his so called
"Hero" never published. Not once, I suspect, did that fool,
that Gloryhound Edwards consider WHY the man hid his discovery
away. Does he think natures guarden of creatures is but a.a.a
grocery store for his convenience? Does he not see how
incredibly unstable the bee coating would inevitably become
when under such constant strain? Edwards, that Gloryhound is
breaking all protocal! He's exposing vulnerable players to
untested materials for extended periods of time and they're
just... they're just letting him! Who knows what form of
crazy reaction those poor boys will have... If only I'd
know these details before, but it's too late. The Golden
Tornadoes are winning, the administration approves, and the
university loves him, their very own Gloryhound.
