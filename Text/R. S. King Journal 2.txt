It happened. Shit hit the fan harder than I predicted.
I knew it would, but never this badly. The coating
formula was always unstable. That Fool Edwards, I warned
him … mutation was inevitable. I saw this coming.
Theorizing he’d cough up a bee every now and then, maybe
begin sweating honey, but to split in to an entire swarm? All
my days of research could not have prepared me… yet it makes
so much sense. Speed quite literally accelerated the process. 
I would call it fascinating if that very same factor had not
the added effect of threatening my own livelihood. We must
act swiftly to clean up this mess. The press can’t know.
The students shouldn’t know. We have to cover everything.
There is no way we can make the football team forget him,
but no amount of fan approval can protect victorious cheaters.
They’ll keep quite. They’ve no other choice. From this point on
Project Golden Experience never existed.
