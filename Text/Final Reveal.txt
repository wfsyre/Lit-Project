BY GOD I FOUND IT! I REALLY FOUND IT. His research!
The Suit! It's all here... The infiltrator was the key
The Suit! It's all here... The infiltrator was the key
They knew somehow. Deep underground in the dead of
night under the pouring rain my shovel found a
switch at the side of Einstein’s Statue. Without a 
second thought I flipped it, and out the statue came
a lone compartment.
The files were right there, fresh as day, right under
all our noses. Einstein you Glorious Bastard!
Bees, of all things, manipulating light to achieve
flight! It's like the plot of a bad sci-fi show, but
the evidence was right there before me.
Just like King said, these documents, they've never
been published, and with good reason.
These findings, along with John's speed suit
stored with it could rock the world as we
know it. Who knows what kinds of monstrosities humanity
would make with this information... Who knows what
kinds of turmoil we could cause. Einstein made the
right move, but it wasn't lasting. No matter how many
times we hide it, People like me, blowhards like Edwards,
Cowards like King and victims like Doe will always 
and forever suffer from power we weren't meant to have.
And now this burden is yours too.

You wont here from me again. For reasons you don't need to
know I have to disappear, but now that you know. What I
do, you've an important choice to make.

Will you share this secret with the world, or keep it to
your grave? The choice is yours.

One last thing. There was another item hidden in that folder.
A single small vial at the bottom of the folder contained
the preserved remains of a bumble bee. Encircling the vial
was a label with the initials "J.D."
