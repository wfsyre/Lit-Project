BY GOD I FOUND IT! I REALLY FOUND IT. I went to the
Einstein Statue and looked around. At first, I didn't
see anything. But then I thought about the intruder,
so in the dead of night I came back with a shovel. I
dug around the statue and loe and behold, I found a
switch burried underground. I flip the swith and from
out of the statue a compartment opens. Hidden inside
I found some very interesting artifacts.

I found a huge stack of files, claiming to be from
Albert Einstein. They were all about reasearch into the
Bees and their strange abilities. These documents must
have never been published before because the I've found
no other references to it in my research. The findings,
if published, would rock all the sciences. Biology,
Physics, Chemistry, Psycology, Neurology, Geology,
Scientology, you name it. 

There was also a prototype of the suit that transformes
John Doe into a swarm of bees. ________________________

Finally, there was a singular small vial, containing
the remains of a single bee. I can only presume that it
is all that remains of the swarm formally known as John
Doe.
