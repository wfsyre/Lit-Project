"The 1917 Georgia Tech Golden Tornado football team[note 1] represented the Georgia Institute of Technology (commonly known as Georgia Tech) in American football during the 1917 college football season as a member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA). The Golden Tornado, coached by John Heisman in his 14th year as head coach, compiled a 9–0 record (4–0 SIAA) and outscored opponents 491 to 17 on the way to its first national championship.[3] Heisman considered the 1917 team his best, and for many years it was considered "the greatest football team the South had ever produced"."
