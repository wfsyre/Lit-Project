I knew it was going to hit the fan, but I didn't
know when and I didn't know how hard. I expected
maybe a few bees here or there. Maybe even Doe
starting to produce some honey from his body, but
to completly turn into bees? I guess I'm not
suprised. We've been working with very volitile
materials and techniques with no safety precidents
to work against. 

Well, guess who now has to clean up this mess. This
is going to be a PR nightmare. We've got to cover
everything up. There is no way we can make the
football team forget him, but maybe we can get them
in on the secret. Promising them a Rose Bowl 1929
victory should shut them up and not soak up too many
resources. His girlfriend will be another issue,
she was always loud one. We might have to dispose of
her in another way.
